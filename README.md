## Description

In order to keep this website optimized for new technologies, I refractered the code.
The goal of the website is to sell a product. A website that can be quickly accessed
with easily scanable code makes it easier to operate, debug, and maintain. 

When working through this code, I thought I broke the website, but it was a naming issue between
the html and css. It was a simple fix. It's important to take time to review code for
typos and semantic discrepensies before making any major changes.
